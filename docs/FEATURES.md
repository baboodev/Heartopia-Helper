- Optional crosshair.
- Restores default camera snapshot when disabled.
- Uses direct camera transform updates in `OnLateUpdate`.

### Noclip

## Resource Gathering

### Foraging (Teleport Farm)

Classic **radar-driven teleport farm**:

1. Requires **Radar enabled** with at least one loot category selected.
2. Teleports player to radar markers for mushrooms, berries, stones, etc.
3. Clicks interact / collects resources.
4. Configurable:
   - Area load delay after teleport
   - Resource click duration
   - Teleport cooldown between targets
   - Auto-repair pause during farm
   - Patrol point list (saved JSON)
   - Loot priority weights (fiddlehead, mustard, burdock, etc.)

Status strings: `IDLE`, `TELEPORTING...`, `GATHERING...`, etc.

### Aura Farm

Server-command style farming without teleporting to each node:

- Resolves game types at runtime via reflection (`ResourceProtocolManager`, `InteractSystem`, `EntityHelper`, etc.).
- Sends pick/attack/hit commands for bushes, trees, and stones in radius (~8 m direct scan).
- Throttled per-target cooldown; merged target cap (32).
- Toggle independent of teleport foraging; both can conflict — UI warns when radar/foraging preconditions fail.

**Requirements:** Radar on + compatible resource toggles; internal method resolution must succeed (logged if `MasterLogAuraFarm` enabled in source).

### Chop & Mine

Tree/stone **patrol automation**:

- Records patrol points with position **and** facing rotation.
- Walks route, chops trees / mines stones via game interaction pipeline.
- Separate saved patrol file: `tree_farm_patrol_points.json` (via unified config).
- Can integrate auto-repair pause like foraging.

### Fishing (`AutoFishingFarm`)

**This is the active fishing system on `main`.** Legacy `AutoFishLogic` / `AutoFishFarm` exist as orphan files but are **not compiled**.

Behavior:

1. Ensures fishing rod equipped (restores previous tool on disable).
2. Scans for fish shadows within detect range (15–200 m, default 60 m).
3. Resolves targets via server/netId-aware game APIs on `HeartopiaComplete`.
4. Casts, waits for bite, handles hook and **reel minigame** via `TrySetFishingPressed` (not legacy Input patches).
5. Tension-aware reel: emergency release below 0.15, resume pull above 0.35.
6. State machine with grace timers for stale states, post-catch recast, lost bait recovery.

UI displays user-friendly status:

- Scanning for fish, Waiting for bite, Fish hooked, Reeling, Catch secured, Fish escaped, etc.

Optional hotkeys: toggle auto fish, teleport fishing route (if configured).

**Note:** Startup log explicitly states `AutoFish subsystem disabled` — refers to the **old** `AutoFishLogic` pipeline, not `AutoFishingFarm`.

### Insects (`InsectNetFarm`)

- Auto equips insect net; restores previous tool on stop.
- Scans catchable insects in range (default 50 m).
- Batch catch (default 3 per tick).
- Optional **patrol teleport** through ~50 predefined world coordinates when no targets nearby.
- Pause teleport during auto-repair / auto-eat (configurable).
- Cooldown between catch attempts (default 1.5 s).

### Birds (`BirdNetFarm`)

- Auto equips bird scanner; multi-catch support (1–10, default 1).
- Capture modes: **Safe Capture** vs **Spam Capture**.
- Perfect photo / auto-scare options.
- Safety stop after 90 s continuous run; 60 s re-enable cooldown.
- Stationary throttling reduces multi-catch when player barely moves.
- Pending server ACK tracking for burst catches.
- Optional crash trace logging to file when verbose flags enabled in source.

### Food & Repair

**Auto Repair**

- Optional teleport backward before repair (configurable distance).

**Auto Eat**

- Default food key: `food_bluejam` (configurable type / custom name).
- Eats until energy full or max attempts reached.
- Trigger: hotkey, toast, or energy % threshold (default 20%).

Both use hard-coded UI hierarchy paths under `GameApp/startup_root(Clone)/XDUIRoot/...` — **game updates can break these paths**.

Throttled background checks (`AutoEatTriggerCheckInterval`, `AutoRepairTriggerCheckInterval`) with slower intervals while farms active.

### Snow Sculpting

- Categories: mushrooms (incl. truffle), berries, stones, ores, trees (apple, mandarin, rare), fish shadows, meteors, misc event resources.
- Toggle per category; select all / clear all.
- Max distance slider (25–1000 m, default 75 m).
- Marker styles: **Default** (icon markers) or **Simple Text**.
- Force refresh scan button.

### Resource Visual ESP

Overlay drawn on top of game view for radar markers:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enable/disable | Tied to radar config |
| Style | Beacon, Card, Minimal |
| Show distance | On-screen distance label |
| Connector line | Line from marker to screen edge |
| Offscreen indicators | Arrows for off-camera targets |
| Scale / opacity | Visual tuning |
| Max markers | Cap (default 120) |

Uses embedded tree icons for some marker types.

### Priority locations

Weighted preference for specific forage types when multiple markers compete (fiddlehead, tall mustard, burdock, mustard greens).

---

## Teleport Tab

- **Preset lists:** home, animal care, NPCs (runtime cache), fast travel, events, houses.
- **Custom teleports:** add current position, name entry, persist to unified config.
- Teleport implementation sets `OverridePosition` + frame counter to hold player at destination through patched movement.
- NPC list rebuilt from game data when available.

---

## Items Selector (Bulk Selector)

- Live-scans bag UI when **live scan** enabled.
- Harmony postfix on `UnityEngine.UI.Image.set_sprite` detects `ui_item_normal*` sprites.
- Builds catalog of discovered item sprite names → UI slot transforms.
- Used for bulk operations on matching inventory slots (sell, select, etc. in same tab).

Caches: `discoveredItems`, `slotCache` static collections on `HeartopiaComplete`.

---

## Settings Tab

Sections typically include:

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| Keybinds | All hotkeys listed in BUILD doc + feature-specific binds |
| UI Theme | Accent, text, tab, window, panel colors; opacity; scale; HSV picker |
| Localization | Language: en, es, zh-CN, pt-BR |
| Notifications | Enable, screen position (9 positions) |
| Overlay | Status overlay toggle |
| Misc | Restore defaults, export-related options |

Config persisted to `%LocalLow%/HelperSettings/Config.xml` (XML serialized `UnifiedConfigData`).

Separate legacy-compatible JSON fragments still loaded line-by-line for some keys in older migration path.

## Master Log Switches (Source Code)

Verbose logging for subsystems is controlled by `private const bool MasterLog*` flags at the top of `HeartopiaComplete.cs`. All are **`false`** in release-style defaults except `MasterLogForceOpenShop = true`.

To enable debug logs, change the relevant constant and rebuild.

---

## Source Files Not in Build

Legacy / experimental files on disk but **excluded from `buddy.csproj`**:

| File(s) | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `AutoFishLogic.cs`, `AutoFishFarm.cs`, `AutoFishGet*.cs` | Old fishing; replaced by `AutoFishingFarm` |
| `InsectFarm.cs` | Replaced by `InsectNetFarm` |
| `MonoEcs*.cs`, `RuntimeDump.cs`, `FishingAutoDump.cs` | Research / dump tooling (see `test` branch) |

Loader entry points **`MelonLoaderPlugin.cs`**, **`BepInExPlugin.cs`**, **`ModLogger.cs`**, and **`ModCoroutines.cs`** are compiled and required for every build.

---

## Safety and Fair Play

- Many features send **real server commands** (aura farm, bird/insect catch, fishing press state) — not purely client visual.
- Bird farm includes deliberate rate limits and safety stops.
- Use private sessions; automation may violate game Terms of Service.

See root [README.md](../README.md) disclaimer.
