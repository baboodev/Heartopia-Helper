## Global Controls

### Menu

- **Toggle menu:** Insert (default), rebindable in Settings.
- **Disable all:** Optional hotkey stops active farms and automation.
- **Status overlay:** Optional HUD showing active features and farm states.
- **Notifications:** Toast-style messages inside the mod UI (position configurable).

### Game speed

Hotkeys (all rebindable, default unbound):

- 1×, 2×, 5×, 10× game speed presets
- Slider in Features → Main; affects `Time.timeScale` clamped 1–10.

### Tool equip hotkeys

Quick-equip (when bound):

- Axe, insect net, fishing rod, sprinkler, bird scanner, building pad

### Pad build hotkeys (`PadBuildHotkeyFeature.cs`)

Keyboard control of the building pad without touching the on-screen `BuildStatusPanel` buttons. Five rebindable keys (Settings → Keybinds, default unbound):

| Key | Action | Behaviour |
|-----|--------|-----------|
| Pad Confirm | `BuildModule.ConfirmPlacing(false)` | Places the held object (panel hold-button parity) |
| Pad Cancel | `BuildModule.CancelPlacing()` | Cancels current placing |
| Pad Rotate | `BuildModule.RotateAround()` | Rotates the held object; 250 ms debounce |
| Pad Move | `BuildModule.InteractExecuteMove()` | Picks up the focused object for moving; no-op in god mode (grab is a click there) |
| Pad Delete | Pad mode: `InteractExecutePickup()` (pack to backpack); god mode: `InteractExecuteDelete()` (wreck) | Removes the focused object |

All five are gated on `BuildModule.SubState == CraftState.Focus` — in simple Pad free-roam (no object focused/being placed) every key is a **silent no-op**. Works in both homeland build modes (Pad/TPS and god top-down view).

Implementation is a three-tier `BuildModule` resolution (managed → AuraMono `Managers.GetModule(Type)` → UI button clicks); see [TYPE_RESOLUTION.md](./TYPE_RESOLUTION.md) and [plans/2026-06-10-pad-build-api-migration.md](./plans/2026-06-10-pad-build-api-migration.md). Debug log flag: `MasterLogPadBuild`.

---

## Self Tab

### Camera Toggle (Mouse Look)

- Orbits camera around player with mouse capture.
- Optional crosshair.
- Restores default camera snapshot when disabled.
- Uses direct camera transform updates in `OnLateUpdate`.

### Noclip

- Enables `OverridePlayerPosition` via Harmony-patched `CharacterController.Move`.
- Movement: WASD, Space/Ctrl vertical, Shift = speed boost multiplier.
- Speed and boost configurable; persisted in config.
- Blocks normal character controller motion while active.

### Anti-AFK

- Periodically simulates mouse input to reduce idle kick.
- Configurable interval (5–120 seconds).

### Building — Bypass Overlap

- Client-side building placement overlap bypass.
- Applies additional Harmony patch on demand (`EnsureBypassPatched`).
- Credits third-party contributor in UI.

---

## Resource Gathering

### Foraging (Teleport Farm)

Classic **radar-driven teleport farm**:

1. Requires **Radar enabled** with at least one loot category selected.
2. Teleports player to radar markers for mushrooms, berries, stones, etc.
3. Clicks interact / collects resources (including meteors via F-key auto-interact when **Aura Farm is off** and meteor radar category is active).
4. Configurable:
   - Area load delay after teleport
   - Resource click duration
   - Teleport cooldown between targets
   - Auto-repair pause during farm
   - Patrol point list (saved JSON)
   - Loot priority weights (fiddlehead, mustard, burdock, etc.)

Status strings: `IDLE`, `TELEPORTING...`, `GATHERING...`, etc.

### Aura Farm

Server-command style farming **without teleporting** to each node:

- Resolves game types at runtime via reflection (`ResourceProtocolManager`, `InteractSystem`, `EntityHelper`, `Entities`, etc.). Details: [TYPE_RESOLUTION.md](./TYPE_RESOLUTION.md).
- Primary target discovery: **AxeChecker** (`HandholdCylinderChecker.PhysicalSelect`) → level-object shapes with `ownerNetId`.
- Sends protocol commands in range:
  - **Bushes** — `SendPickBushCommand`
  - **Trees** — `SendAttackTreeCommand`
  - **Stones** — `SendHitStoneCommand`
- Throttled scan (80 ms tick, 20 ms per-owner cooldown); merged target cap (32).
- Toggle independent of teleport foraging; both can conflict — UI warns when radar/foraging preconditions fail.

#### Meteorites (starfall rocks)

When live meteor props (`p_rock_meteorite*`) are near the player, Aura Farm treats matching AxeChecker targets as meteorites:

1. Scans scene for meteor GameObject positions (~1 s interval, 3 m match radius).
2. **Auto-equips axe** (hand tool id **1**) before mining.
3. Resolves **logic parent** `netId` from the view `ownerNetId` (`CollectableMeteoriteViewComponent` → `CollectableMeteoriteLogic` / `MeteoriteLogic`). `HitStone` must target the **parent**, not the view entity.
4. Sends `SendHitStoneCommand(parentNetId)` — same server path as `PlayerAxeAttackStoneAction`, not bush pick or F-key interact.
5. Refreshes target list and invalidates stale caches when moving between meteors (no toggle restart needed).

**Interaction with teleport foraging:** While Aura Farm is enabled, **meteor auto-interact** (F + UI click during START FORAGING) is disabled — meteors are handled only via Aura Farm API. Enabling Aura Farm also stops any in-progress meteor interact sequence.

**Requirements:** Player within axe range of the meteor; `ResourceProtocolManager.SendHitStoneCommand` (managed or Mono) must resolve. Debug: set `MasterLogAuraFarm = true` in `HeartopiaComplete.cs` and rebuild.

### Chop & Mine

Tree/stone **patrol automation**:

- Records patrol points with position **and** facing rotation.
- Walks route, chops trees / mines stones via game interaction pipeline.
- Separate saved patrol file: `tree_farm_patrol_points.json` (via unified config).
- Can integrate auto-repair pause like foraging.

### Fishing (`AutoFishingFarm`)

**This is the active fishing system on `main`.** (The legacy `AutoFishLogic` / `AutoFishFarm` input-simulation orphans were deleted.)

Behavior:

1. Ensures fishing rod equipped (restores previous tool on disable).
2. Scans for fish shadows within detect range (15–200 m, default 60 m).
3. Resolves targets via server/netId-aware game APIs on `HeartopiaComplete`.
4. Casts, waits for bite, handles hook and **reel minigame** via `TrySetFishingPressed` (not legacy Input patches).
5. Tension-aware reel: emergency release below 0.15, resume pull above 0.35.
6. State machine with grace timers for stale states, post-catch recast, lost bait recovery.

UI displays user-friendly status:

- Scanning for fish, Waiting for bite, Fish hooked, Reeling, Catch secured, Fish escaped, etc.

Optional hotkeys: toggle auto fish, teleport fishing route (if configured).

**Note:** Startup log explicitly states `AutoFish subsystem disabled` — refers to the **old** `AutoFishLogic` pipeline, not `AutoFishingFarm`.

### Insects (`InsectNetFarm`)

- Auto equips insect net; restores previous tool on stop.
- Scans catchable insects in range (default 50 m).
- Batch catch (default 3 per tick).
- Optional **patrol teleport** through ~50 predefined world coordinates when no targets nearby.
- Pause teleport during auto-repair / auto-eat (configurable).
- Cooldown between catch attempts (default 1.5 s).

### Birds (`BirdNetFarm`)

- Auto equips bird scanner; multi-catch support (1–10, default 1).
- Capture modes: **Safe Capture** vs **Spam Capture**.
- Perfect photo / auto-scare options.
- Safety stop after 90 s continuous run; 60 s re-enable cooldown.
- Stationary throttling reduces multi-catch when player barely moves.
- Pending server ACK tracking for burst catches.
- Optional crash trace logging to file when verbose flags enabled in source.

## Features Tab

### Main

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Hide UI + Player | Client-side visibility hiding |
| Bird Vacuum | Client-side bird collection assist |
| Custom Camera FOV | Overrides main camera FOV while enabled |
| FPS bypass | Raises target FPS cap |
| Bypass UI | Skips certain UI blocking |
| Auto click start / close announcement | Login flow helpers |
| Join public / friend / my town | Room join automation |
| Inspect player / move | Debug-style player inspection |
| Hide ID / custom display ID | Social name display tweaks |
| Block game UI when menu open | Input focus helper |
| Stranger chat logging | Optional (master log flag off by default) |

### Food & Repair

**Auto Repair**

- Opens bag UI programmatically, finds repair kit (standard or crafty), clicks Use, closes bag.
- Trigger modes: manual hotkey, toast notification, **durability percentage threshold** (default 10%).
- Optional teleport backward before repair (configurable distance).

**Auto Eat**

- Default food key: `food_bluejam` (configurable type / custom name).
- Eats until energy full or max attempts reached.
- Trigger: hotkey, toast, or energy % threshold (default 20%).

Both use hard-coded UI hierarchy paths under `GameApp/startup_root(Clone)/XDUIRoot/...` — **game updates can break these paths**.

Throttled background checks (`AutoEatTriggerCheckInterval`, `AutoRepairTriggerCheckInterval`) with slower intervals while farms active.

### Snow Sculpting

**Tab:** Features → **Snow Sculpting** (`automationSubTab == 2`). Source: `buddy/SnowSculptureFeature.cs` (partial `HeartopiaComplete`).

#### Auto Snow Sculpture

- Configurable click interval (default 20 ms).
- When `SnowSculpturePanel` is open and in **Round** state: invokes `OnPressDown` for all lit QTE buttons via AuraMono (`GetView<SnowSculpturePanel>` → `_lightButtons`). The game sends `ReportSculptingScore` on round end — the mod does **not** duplicate score packets while the panel path is active.
- Fallback (no panel): `SnowSculptureProtocolManager.ReportSculptingScore` / `SendCommand` if managed types resolve.
- Status box: round count + last API status line.

#### Auto Click Icon

- Configurable interval (default 50 ms).
- Replaces UI clicks on the tracking interact icon with the game interact pipeline:
  1. Collect interact targets (`InteractSystem` via AuraMono + static helper).
  2. `ConfirmExecuteHasTargetCommand` for snow commands **15** (start sculpt), **14** (put snowball), **16** (gather statue) — skip if confirm dialog required.
  3. `PlayerInteraction.ExecuteHasTargetCommand(levelObjectId, commandId)` (managed + AuraMono).
- Skips while the snow sculpture QTE panel is already open.
- Decompiled reference: `InteractTrackCellModel.TriggerOnClickByView` → same `ExecuteHasTargetCommand` call.

#### Move snowballs to backpack

- Button **Move snowballs to backpack** on the same tab.
- Scans **warehouse only** (`EStorageType` **2**), filters stacks with **`staticId == 5100`** (Snowball). Locked stacks are skipped.
- Sends `BackpackProtocolManager.MoveBatchBackpackItems` → bag (`targetStorageType` **1**), chunked at 256 stacks per batch (same as Bag/Warehouse transfer). See [BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md](./BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md).

#### Debug

- `MasterLogSnowSculpture` in `SnowSculptureFeature.cs` (default **false**) — `[SnowSculpture]` lines in `helper.log`.

### Auto Buy

- Teleport → open cooking store → buy configured items → return.
- Master log flag `MasterLogAutoBuy` / `MasterLogForceOpenShop` in source.

### Buy All (Coin) — Selected Shop

- **Menu:** **Features** tab → same dropdown as **Force Open Shop** → **BUY ALL (COIN)**.
- **File:** `buddy/ShopBuyAllFeature.cs` (partial `HeartopiaComplete`).
- **Flow:** coroutine with 2-frame warmup → list goods → filter → buy loop (~100 ms between purchases). Status line under the button.
- **No UI clicks** — protocol only.

#### What gets bought

Includes only items where all of the following hold:

| Field | Value |
|-------|--------|
| `storeMoneyType` | `StoreMoneyType.Currency` |
| `currencyType` | `CurrencyType.Coin` (1) |
| `isUnlock` | true |
| `leftCount` | > 0 |
| `price` | > 0 |

**Skips already owned** (not offered again):

- `boughtCount > 0` on limited-one slots
- `PlayerServiceSystem.GetItemCount(itemStaticId) > 0`
- managed path: `ShopItemData.isObtained`
- avatar rewards: `ShopSystem.CheckIfAvatarHasObtain` (AuraMono)

Coin balance is read via `PlayerServiceSystem.GetCurrencyCount(Coin)`; unaffordable items are skipped.

#### Purchase paths

| Store type | `storeId` | API |
|------------|-----------|-----|
| Normal NPC shops (cooking, garden, general, …) | per dropdown / resolved | `ShopShelfProtocolManager.BuyItem` (AuraMono); managed `ShopSystem.BuyItem(netId, count)` if types load |
| **Clothing Store** | **5** (`DressShopPanel`) | `ShopShelfProtocolManager.BuyClothes` (AuraMono `List<ClothesStoreEntry>`, `wear: false`) — **not** `BuyItem` |

Clothing buys **one piece per command** (game API), not stack count.

#### Listing goods

1. Managed: `ShopSystem.GetStoreGoodsData(storeId)` when `FindLoadedType` works.
2. Fallback AuraMono: same method on `DataModule<ShopSystem>` instance.

`ShopItemData` is read via **field-only** access in the Aura path (`_leftCount`, `rewardData.staticId`, …) — no property getters on structs (avoids crashes).

#### Unsupported shops

| Dropdown entry | Reason |
|----------------|--------|
| Face Shop | Not a Coin `ShopPanel` store |
| Meteor / Starfall Exchange | Item cost (shards), not Coin — `WeatherExchangeShopPanel` |

#### Store IDs (Force Open / buy-all)

Same mapping as `TryResolveForceOpenShopStoreId` in `HeartopiaComplete.cs` (e.g. cooking **53**, garden **51**, clothing **5**, general store resolved at runtime). See **Force Open Shop** below.

#### Debug

- Errors always logged: `[ShopBuyAll] …`
- Verbose steps: set `MasterLogAutoBuy = true` in source (shared with Auto Buy).

### Force Open Shop

- Menu: **Features** tab → dropdown of hardcoded shops → **OPEN SELECTED SHOP**.
- Normal NPC stores: `ShopPanel.OpenShopPanel(storeId)` via AuraMono (`TryOpenShopPanelByStoreId`).
- Fortune rainbow/rain (wish stars): storeId **86** / **87** — still `ShopPanel`, not exchange.
- **Meteor / Starfall exchange** (Doris, starfall shards): `WeatherExchangeShopPanel.OpenWeatherExchangePanel` — storeId **140** (`MeteorStarfallExchangeStoreId`).
- How to add or debug similar panels (IL2CPP vs mono hooks, `storeId` discovery): **[TYPE_RESOLUTION.md § UI panels, hooks, and IL2CPP](./TYPE_RESOLUTION.md#ui-panels-hooks-and-il2cpp-worked-example-weather-exchange-shop)**.

### Auto Sell

- **Scan source:** Bag only, Warehouse only, or **Both** (dropdown).
- **Obtain:** `BackPackSystem.GetAllItem` per storage (managed + AuraMono); optional runtime snapshot when scanning warehouse-only.
- **Filter:** configured item key (descriptor substring / `p_` photo prefix); **star filter** (0 = any, 1–5 = exact star); **skip 5★**; reserve count per group; max per stack; sell full stack.
- **Sort:** none — all matching `netId` stacks are aggregated and sold.
- Interval-based loop; can hide bag items from normal UI while running.

See [BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md](./BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md#auto-sell-detail).

### Mass Cook (Net Cook)

- Patrol-based mass cooking at saved cooking patrol points (position + rotation per station).
- Scans radius for cook targets; optional mini-game-only mode.
- Config: interval, scan radius, wait at spot, cooking speed.
- Coroutine warmup on mod init (`NetCookCoroutineWarmupRoutine`).

### Puzzle (`PuzzleNetFeature`)

- Detects puzzle UI open state.
- Reads piece layout from game objects / net IDs.
- Auto-solves placement puzzle when enabled.
- Shows `Solving...` / `Waiting for puzzle target...` status.
- Disables itself after successful solve or on error.

### Pet Care

**Pet Feed (`PetFeedFeature`)**

- Feed all visible cats or dogs in sequence.
- Cooldown between bulk feed runs.
- Per-pet single feed from UI list.
- Food list from `PetSystem.GetFoods()` (not a full-bag scan); sorts by **lowest fullness** first, then `staticId`.
- Optional selected-food filter in UI.

See [BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md](./BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md#pet-feed-detail).

**Pet Play (`PetPlayFeature`)**

- **Auto Cat Play:** answers cat QTE prompts automatically.
- **Auto Dog Train:** handles dog training QTE flow.
- Independent toggles + hotkeys.

---

## Radar Tab

### Core radar

- Scans world for configured resource prefabs / markers.
- Categories: mushrooms (incl. truffle), berries, stones, ores, trees (apple, mandarin, rare), fish shadows, meteors, misc event resources.
- Toggle per category; select all / clear all.
- Max distance slider (25–1000 m, default 75 m).
- Marker styles: **Default** (icon markers) or **Simple Text**.
- Force refresh scan button.

### Resource Visual ESP

Overlay drawn on top of game view for radar markers:

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Enable/disable | Tied to radar config |
| Style | Beacon, Card, Minimal |
| Show distance | On-screen distance label |
| Connector line | Line from marker to screen edge |
| Offscreen indicators | Arrows for off-camera targets |
| Scale / opacity | Visual tuning |
| Max markers | Cap (default 120) |

Uses embedded tree icons for some marker types.

### Priority locations

Weighted preference for specific forage types when multiple markers compete (fiddlehead, tall mustard, burdock, mustard greens).

---

## Teleport Tab

- **Preset lists:** home, animal care, NPCs (runtime cache), fast travel, events, houses.
- **Custom teleports:** add current position, name entry, persist to unified config.
- Teleport implementation sets `OverridePosition` + frame counter to hold player at destination through patched movement.
- NPC list rebuilt from game data when available.

---

## Bag / Warehouse

- Scans **Bag** or **Warehouse** through `BackPackSystem.GetAllItem` (AuraMono), one row per `netId` stack.
- Grid sorted by **display name** (A→Z); user picks stacks (no auto “cheapest” picker).
- Transfer sends `BackpackProtocolManager.MoveBatchBackpackItems` (`BatchMoveNetworkCommand`, max 256 stacks per request; mod chunks larger batches).
- Direction: Bag → Warehouse (`targetStorageType = 2`), Warehouse → Bag (`targetStorageType = 1`).
- Does **not** require opening the in-game bag, warehouse tab, or multi-select UI.
- Optional **Multi** mode: click stacks to build a batch, set quantity, then **Transfer**.
- Locked stacks are shown but skipped on send.
- **Warehouse Anywhere:** while the game bag UI is open, unlocks the warehouse tab client-side (does not move items by itself).

Full pipeline: [BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md](./BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md#bag--warehouse-transfer-detail).

---

## New Features — Animal Care & Daily Quests

### Wild animal feed (`WildAnimalFeedFeature`)

- Scans **backpack** via `GetAllItem`; matches food allowed for the animal **group** (fullness table per `staticId` + star).
- **Skip 5 Star Food** (default on): never uses 5★ food.
- Picks food with highest score: bond EXP (favorites weighted) + fullness contribution.
- Manual **Feed**; separate from daily quests.

### Wild animal gifts (`WildAnimalGiftFeature`)

- **Claim All Wild Gifts** (Animal Care tab): collects pending gift `netId`s from loaded ECS entities, then calls `AnimalProtocolManager.TakeGift` per target (~0.45 s between claims).
- **Pending count:** `WildAnimalProtocolManager.HaveGift()` → `IWildAnimalService.HaveGift()` (AuraMono) returns `AnimalGroup` ids with red-dot gifts.
- **Target discovery (AuraMono only):** entity scan over `TryEnumerateAuraMonoLoadedEntityObjects` — for each `netId`, `AnimalProtocolManager.GetNetworkEntity`, then:
  - **Gift boxes:** `AnimalUtil.IsGiftBox` + `AnimalUtil.GetGroup` must match a pending group.
  - **Animal-carried gifts:** `WildAnimalProtocolManager.HaveGift(EcsEntity)` + `AnimalUtil.GetGroup` in pending groups.
- **Claim:** `AnimalProtocolManager.TakeGift(uint)` → `AnimalGiftTakeNetworkCommand`.
- Does **not** use managed `EcsService.TryGet<IWildAnimalService>`, `DataCenter.TryGetComponentData`, or level-object scan (those paths fail or are redundant under BepInEx).
- Details, logs, troubleshooting: [BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md](./BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md#wild-animal-gifts-detail).

### Daily Quests

| Control | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Auto submit items** | For orders in **CanSubmit** state, builds `List<ItemNetPair>` on game Mono and calls `ClientSubmitTaskItem` / `ClientSubmitNpcTaskItem`. |
| **Skip 5 Star Items** | Excludes 5★ stacks from submission (saved in config). |

**Item selection (auto submit):**

1. Enumerate **backpack + warehouse** (`EStorageType` 1 and 2).
2. Match targets via `CheckSubmitItems` (all targets) and `CheckSubmitItem`; honor `quality` on target rows.
3. Sort matches: **lowest sell price**, then **lowest star**.
4. Fill `needNum` from cheapest stacks; skip locked and (optional) 5★.

Does **not** use `AutoSubmitNpcTaskItem` success alone — that only opens NPC dialogue in vanilla UI.

Details and troubleshooting: [BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md](./BACKPACK_AND_ITEMS.md#daily-quests-detail).

---

## New Features — Pictures (ScreenCapture)

Decrypts `persistentDataPath/ScreenCapture` to `ScreenCaptureDecrypted` (AES, same as game `EncryptUtil`). **Encrypt changed** re-imports only files whose plain SHA256 differs from `.heartopia-helper-manifest.json`.

**Draw** files are palette index maps (`TextureFormat.R8`), not normal photos. On decrypt:

- `Draw/{id}_{w}_{h}.png` — colored RGBA preview (editable)
- `Draw/.index/{id}_{w}_{h}.png` — original index PNG for lossless roundtrip

Palette comes from the in-game `drawing_lut` texture (128 colors; cached as `ScreenCaptureDecrypted/.drawing_color_lut.png`). Edited colors outside the palette are quantized to the nearest entry on re-encrypt.

**Upload edited drawing to the server** (open the drawing at your easel first): **Extract open drawing** dumps the live canvas to `ScreenCaptureDecrypted/drawing.png`; edit it; **Upload drawing.png** pushes the pixels to the server (DrawBoard protocol) and refreshes the in-game preview/thumbnail. This is server-authoritative — editing the local cache alone does **not** change the drawing in-game.

CLI parity: `tools/screen_capture_crypto.py` (`decrypt` / `encrypt-changed` / `decode-draw` / `encode-draw`; `pip install pycryptodome pillow`). Palette files: `tools/gen_drawing_palette.py`.

**Full technical reference (types, AuraMono access, protocol): [DRAW_TECHNICAL.md](./DRAW_TECHNICAL.md).**

---

## New Features — Homeland Farm

Crop-box (planter) farming inside your homeland. All operations are **radius-based** around the player and send real server commands. Implemented in `HomelandFarmFeature.cs` (resolved via reflection + **AuraMono** native path — managed component types are absent under BepInEx).

Tab layout (top → bottom):

1. **Auto Farming** — Capture planters + Start / Stop.
2. **Farm Radius** — single slider (1–80 m) driving every operation below; **persisted to config**.
3. **Crops** — seed source (Backpack / Warehouse / Both), Refresh seeds, seed selector.
4. **Fertilizer** — fertilizer source, Refresh fertilizers, fertilizer selector.
5. **Operations** — buttons: Water in radius · Harvest · Weed · Collect seeds · **Sow** · **Fertilize** · Log diagnostics.
6. Status panel + **Stop** (cancels the running operation).

### Manual operations (radius)

| Button | Action | Owner filter |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| Water in radius | Waters crop boxes + plants (batch = watering hobby-skill cell count) | any |
| Weed | Removes the `hasWeed` flag on crops | any |
| Harvest | Collects ripe crops (`stage == 4`) | **own only** |
| Collect seeds | Collects ready plant seeds | any |
| Sow | Fills empty planter slots with the **selected seed** (batch = sprinkler/hobby cell count) | own |
| Fertilize | Applies the **selected fertilizer** to own crops | own |

Item names in the seed/fertilizer selectors resolve through the same game-table path as the Bag / Auto Sell tabs (`TableData.GetBackPackName` first), so labels match across the mod.

### Auto Farming

**Capture planters** snapshots the crop boxes in radius (like Mass Cook "Capture Stoves") and pins the working-zone center. **Start auto farm** then runs an autonomous loop (disabled until seeds are selected):

1. **Discovery first** — one radius scan builds a crop-netId cache (so it never re-sows already-occupied planters on restart).
2. **Poll** the cached crops directly (no re-scan): remove weeds, harvest ripe crops, drop them from the cache.
3. **Sow** a new generation **only when the zone holds no crops** (start, or after the whole generation is harvested) and a post-sow cooldown has elapsed — prevents re-sowing boxes the server hasn't registered yet (`MaxPlantCountLimit`).
4. **Time-scheduled weeding** — sleep is driven by the crops' exact maturity (`mature = sowTime + ripeGrowTime − growTime`, read from `CropItemData`; "now" via the game clock `GameTimeUtility.GetUnixTime()`). Coarse weeding while far from ripe; **weed every second in the final minute** before harvest.

**Stop:** manual (Stop button / Stop auto farm), or automatic once the selected seed runs out **and** the last harvest is collected.

Enable `MasterLogHomelandFarm` for per-tick logs (`Auto crop timing`, `Auto poll`, `next ripe in …`).

### Entity discovery — the scan funnel

Every farm operation (manual button, hotkey, auto-farm, capture) resolves its target net-ids through one funnel, `TryHomelandFarmCollectFarmEntityNetIds` in `HomelandFarmFeature.cs`. Sources are tried in order; cheap/cached ones first, the expensive native walk last:

| # | Source | Notes |
|---|--------|-------|
| 1 | RegisteredCache | Persisted targets from earlier discovery. Skipped for capture (`useAutoFarmCollectShortcuts:false`) and skips zero-position entries in spatial scans. |
| 2 | InteractSeeds | Current interact-target seeds. |
| 3 | **ComponentRadius (direct ECS)** | `Entities.GetComponents<CropBoxComponent/CropComponent/PlantComponent>` via the AuraMono generic-invoke path. **This is now the primary source** and returns the authoritative crop-box + crop + plant set. |
| 4 | SphereQuery / Cylinder | Entity spatial queries — return 0 on this build. |
| 5 | LevelObjectCache | In-memory level-object position cache (crop boxes are level objects). |
| 6 | AuraProximity | Walks the nearby-entity list and classifies each — the native, crash-prone path. |
| 7 | AuraEntities | Full recursive loaded-entity graph walk — the most crash-prone path. |

**Key change (June 2026):** the direct-ECS source (#3) used to be considered unsafe and was gated off, so discovery fell back to the crash-prone proximity / graph walk (#6/#7), which randomly hit uncatchable native access-violations on **visiting other players' fields** (shared local coordinates, streaming entities). The AuraMono `GetComponents<T>` path was brought up and now works reliably (see [TYPE_RESOLUTION.md → AuraMono generic `GetComponents<T>`](./TYPE_RESOLUTION.md#auramono-generic-getcomponentst-direct-ecs-query)). When #3 succeeds, a `componentRadiusSucceeded` flag now **skips both #6 and #7 on every path**, removing the native-AV exposure. The proximity / graph walk only runs as a fallback if the direct query returns nothing (e.g. a field with no crop boxes, crops, or plants).

Caps still apply as a safety bound on the fallback walk: the inspect cap and global entity/level-object enumeration caps are raised to 8192 for dense homelands.

## New Features — Extras (Ice Skating)

The **Extras** sub-tab (`newFeaturesSubTab == 4`) hosts two independent ice-skating tools, drawn top → bottom by `DrawIceSkatingExtrasTab` (`IceSkatingSequenceFeature.cs`), which renders the network-sequence buttons and then calls `DrawExtraTab` (`AutoIceSkatingFeature.cs`) underneath:

1. **Perfect Ice Skating** (network sequences) — `IceSkatingSequenceFeature.cs`.
2. **Auto Ice Skating** (real-time bot) — `AutoIceSkatingFeature.cs`.

### Perfect Ice Skating (network sequences)

Server-command driven runs that don't require you to be skating in real time:

| Button | Action |
|--------|--------|
| Challenge (5 perfect, 1500) | Runs a scripted challenge sequence aiming for a perfect score (~1500). `Runs` field sets repetitions. |
| Perfect Drill | Repeated perfect-action drill. `Runs` field sets repetitions. |

A run count field (`DrawIceSkatingRunCountField`, clamped to `IceSkatingSequenceMaxRunCount`) sits beside each button. Only one sequence runs at a time (`iceSkatingSequenceCoroutine` gate). Loader log tag: `[IceSkatingSeq]`.

### Auto Ice Skating (real-time bot)

`AutoIceSkatingFeature.cs` — a `partial class HeartopiaComplete` split. Watches the local player's `GameSkateMode` each frame and **chains skate tricks automatically while you still control movement**. Toggle it on the Extras tab or via the **Auto Ice Skating** hotkey (Settings → Keybinds → PLAYER, default unbound).

**Type resolution.** Managed reflection is tried first; if the managed types are absent (the BepInEx IL2CPP build), it falls back to the **AuraMono** native path (`mono_runtime_invoke`). Both execution paths are kept in full parity. Resolved surfaces: `LocalPlayerComponent.GetGameMode<GameSkateMode>` (or `Character.GetMode<…>`), `GameSkateMode` (`SkillTrigger`, `CanTriggerUltimate`, `CalculateSpeedRate`, `IsReceiver`, `GetRatioInConfiguredPhase`, `actived`, `Energy`, `SkateSkills`, `UltimateSkill`, `_currentCastAction`, `_skateActions`, `ChallengeInfo`), and `TableData` (`GetSkateAction`, `GetSkateActionType`, `GetSkateActionState`, `GetPairSkateUltimate`). Resolution retries every 5 s until the player enters the rink; a circuit breaker disables the tick after repeated exceptions.

**Decision logic per frame** (`TickAutoIceSkating` / `TickAutoIceSkatingAura`):

1. **Not skating / inactive / pair-receiver** → idle. Pair *receiver* is manual-only (the partner drives). After entering the ice there is a short warm-up, and at challenge start a 3 s countdown is skipped.
2. **Performing an action** → first try an ultimate (see below); otherwise honour the **Perfect move** setting.
3. **Idle (no action playing)** → try an ultimate, else pick and trigger the next simple move.

**Simple-move selection** (`PickAutoIceSkatingBestSkill`): for each skill in the current tree it reads whether the action is **new** (challenge novelty bonus, `ChallengeData.IsNewAction`) and its **duration** (sum of phase spans from `TableSkateActionState.phase`). Ranking:

- **Prefer new move** on (default): new actions outrank used ones; ties broken by shortest duration.
- **Prefer new move** off: ranked purely by shortest duration.

**Perfect-move timing** (`TryAutoIceSkatingTryPerfectInterrupt*`):

- **Perfect move** on (default): the next move is triggered inside the perfect window (`GetRatioInConfiguredPhase` over the action's `prefectPhase`), so each chained trick scores its perfect bonus.
- **Perfect move** off: the next move is chained **as soon as the game allows an interrupt** (the game's `SkillTrigger` still gates blend time / non-interruptible phases) — faster chaining, no waiting for perfect.

**Ultimate selection** (`TryAutoIceSkatingSelectUltimate*`): scans the skill tree, resolves each branch's ultimate via `GetSkateActionType(actionType).ultimateActionId`, scores it, and picks the **shortest ultimate whose final score ≥ the Ultimate-cost slider**. Energy gate:

- **Only x2 ultimate** on (default): an ultimate is cast only at energy tier ≥ x2 (≥ 200 energy).
- **Only x2 ultimate** off: tier x1 (≥ 100) is allowed.
- **Last 30s ultimate** on (default): when the challenge timer drops below 30 s, the gate falls to x1 regardless of the above — spend stored energy before it's wasted at time-up. The score floor (slider) still applies.

Ultimate scoring mirrors the game's `GameSkateMode.SettleActionEnergy` / `CalculateBaseScore`: `final = (score + bonus·if-new) × (1 + prefectScoreRatio) × speedRate × repeat-decay`, where `speedRate` is 0.5–2.0 from `CalculateSpeedRate()` (your real speed) and pair skates override score/bonus via `TablePairSkateUltimate`. Keep your speed high for the ×2 multiplier. The scan result is cached briefly (≈0.35 s) keyed by the skill-set hash.

**Controls** (Extras tab, under the network buttons):

| Control | Default | Meaning |
|---------|---------|---------|
| Auto Ice Skating (toggle) | off | Master enable. |
| Ultimate cost (min score) — slider | 900 | Minimum final score an ultimate must reach to be cast. Range 0–2000, step 50. |
| Only x2 ultimate (skip x1) | on | Require energy tier x2 for ultimates. |
| Last 30s ultimate | on | Allow x1 ultimate when challenge timer < 30 s. |
| Perfect move | on | Off → chain moves as soon as available, not waiting for the perfect window. |
| Prefer new move | on | Off → pick simple moves purely by shortest duration. |

All controls and the hotkey are **persisted** in the keybind config (`KeybindConfigData`); defaults come from field initializers, so configs predating this feature upgrade to on / 900.

**Debug logging.** `MasterLogAutoIceSkating` (top of `HeartopiaComplete.cs`, default `false`). When enabled, every trigger and every ultimate skip logs the full property dump of the action(s) — `id type dur score bonus new prefScore energy prefEnergy iconTip pair ult` — and selection logs list each candidate the same way, so you can see exactly how moves differ (duration, score, bonuses) and why an ultimate was skipped (`below-min` / `ok`).

**Crash-hardening.** `GameSkateMode.ChallengeInfo` is a **struct** (`ChallengeData`) read raw into a stack buffer via `mono_field_get_value`. `mono_field_get_offset` is boxed-relative (includes the 16-byte object header), so the Aura path subtracts `2 * IntPtr.Size` for `UsedActions` / `Timestamp` / `Duration`; a missing subtraction read `Timestamp` as a fake pointer and hard-crashed mono at challenge start. Pointers read from the raw buffer are also alignment/`>= 0x10000` checked before any `mono_object_get_class` (native AVs are uncatchable). See `memory/auramono-struct-field-offsets.md`.

## Settings Tab

Sections typically include:

| Section | Contents |
|---------|----------|
| Keybinds | All hotkeys listed in BUILD doc + feature-specific binds |
| UI Theme | Accent, text, tab, window, panel colors; opacity; scale; HSV picker |
| Localization | Language: en, es, zh-CN, pt-BR |
| Notifications | Enable, screen position (9 positions) |
| Overlay | Status overlay toggle |
| Performance | FPS bypass; LOD override (game default / better / performance / custom bias & max level) |
| Misc | Restore defaults, export-related options |

Config persisted to `%LocalLow%/HelperSettings/Config.xml` (XML serialized `UnifiedConfigData`). Persisted values include keybinds (incl. **Water + Weed Radius**), theme, radar, patrols, bird farm, and the **Homeland Farm radius** (`homelandFarmWaterRadius`, clamped 1–80, default 30).

Separate legacy-compatible JSON fragments still loaded line-by-line for some keys in older migration path.

## Keybind Reference

All default to **KeyCode.None** except menu toggle. Grouped as in Settings → Keybinds:

| Section | Keybinds |
|---------|----------|
| CORE | Toggle Menu (**Insert**), Toggle Radar, Bypass UI, Disable All, Inspect Player, Inspect Move |
| AUTOMATION | Auto Foraging, Aura Farm, Water + Weed Radius, Auto Insect Farm, Auto Bird Farm, Fish Shadow Net, Mass Cook, Auto Puzzle, Auto Cat Play, Auto Dog Train, Auto Pet Wash, Feed All Cats, Feed All Dogs, Auto Snow Sculpture, Bird Vacuum, Spawn Bubble, Auto Repair, Auto Eat |
| PLAYER | Noclip, Camera Toggle, Auto Ice Skating, Join My Town, Anti AFK, Bypass Overlap |
| SPEED & TOOLS | Game Speed 1×/2×/5×/10×, Equip Axe / Net / Rod / Sprinkler / Bird Scanner / Pad, Pad Confirm / Cancel / Rotate / Move / Delete |

Rebind by clicking the button in Settings and pressing a new key. Mouse buttons are bindable too. Layout note: panel section heights are sized by row count (`BeginKeybindSection` rowCount) and the scroll height by `CalculateSettingsTabHeight` — both must be bumped when adding rows, or the new rows render outside the panel/scroll.

---

## Master Log Switches (Source Code)

Verbose logging for subsystems is controlled by `private const bool MasterLog*` flags at the top of `HeartopiaComplete.cs`. All are **`false`** in release-style defaults except `MasterLogForceOpenShop = true`.

To enable debug logs, change the relevant constant and rebuild.

---

## Source Files Not in Build

Legacy / experimental files on disk but **excluded from `buddy.csproj`**:

| File(s) | Notes |
|---------|-------|
| `AutoFishLogic.cs`, `AutoFishFarm.cs`, `AutoFishGet*.cs` | Old fishing; replaced by `AutoFishingFarm` |
| `InsectFarm.cs` | Replaced by `InsectNetFarm` |
| `MonoEcs*.cs`, `RuntimeDump.cs`, `FishingAutoDump.cs` | Research / dump tooling (see `test` branch) |

Loader entry points **`MelonLoaderPlugin.cs`**, **`BepInExPlugin.cs`**, **`ModLogger.cs`**, and **`ModCoroutines.cs`** are compiled and required for every build.

---

## Safety and Fair Play

- Many features send **real server commands** (aura farm, bird/insect catch, fishing press state) — not purely client visual.
- Bird farm includes deliberate rate limits and safety stops.
- Use private sessions; automation may violate game Terms of Service.
